# torus

Algorithm: Generate particles with "color charges".
Atoms move relative to each other according to a gravity-like force,
with a distance metric adapted for a square-torus topology.
Force is proportional to color similarity and inverse-square of distance.
Draw traces of each particle.

Edit configuration options in `src/main.rs` to change the drawing.
